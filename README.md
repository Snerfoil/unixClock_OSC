# unixClock_OSC

give your avi the animator params of

ringSec
ringMin
ringHr
ringDay
ringWeek
ringMonth
ringYear
ringDecade
ringCentury
ringUnix

where each one is a float value.  it will display the current time in my weird unix format. btw the names of these arent reflective of their actual real world counter parts as they are just appx to the nearest set of bits.
